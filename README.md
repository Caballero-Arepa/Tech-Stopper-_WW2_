# Tech-Stopper-_WW2_
This mod doesn't allow to continue on further techs, to the point that would be the WW2 techs, perfect for roleplaying ww2 or something.

This mod does not change the base game (apart from closing the tech tree), with the exception of moving the Atomic Bomber unit to Atomic Theroy tech, and reducing it's life to 65 Strenght from 150, so it's more accurate.
